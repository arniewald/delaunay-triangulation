Alternative way to compute the labels: minimize curvature of the resulting surface.
Need to know in which format we will receive the data.

Take beans or yeast and train them (artesania).
length beans: 3474

80% training, 10% validation, 10% test.
    - TEST ONLY ONCE!!!
    - Validation to tune parameters
    - Training: triangulation and mse minimization.
Without moving points, find the optimal:
    - Number of points of triangulation
    - avw
    - random or entropic

Choices of an appropiate triangulation will have to be made.
Can we measure overlapping?
