Alternative way to compute the labels: minimize curvature of the resulting surface.
Higher dimensions
Need to know in which format we will receive the data.
Improve visualization of the surface
Optimization 
Fix the data origin
Predict new points
Non-euclidean distances

Look for new datasets to try (not limited but including 3Dclassification)
Document the code

Implement 3 classes classification and try it with Iris, only distance, adding barycenters but not too many. 
COMPARE WITH PREVIOUS TRIALS (DO NOT OVERWRITE IT!!!).
Think of a way of not adding too many barycenters (problematic for small datasets).
Check if memory works better than rank check.
