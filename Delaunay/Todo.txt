Alternative way to compute the labels: minimize curvature of the resulting surface.
Higher dimensions
Need to know in which format we will receive the data.
Improve visualization of the surface
Optimization 
Fix the data origin
Predict new points
Non-euclidean distances

Visualize 3D simplices
Try in 3d -> I don't think it is working, incoherent results again for Iris (for Classification it does not look like it)
If 3d works, dataset petals (quit width of cepal). If that works, use full dataset (R4): Iris dataset (from sklearn).
    - Use one third of points to triangulate
    - First try one class versus the others
    - Implement multiple label classificator (triangle instead of segment)
Study errors of training points


Add points to convex hull edges (extend to n dimensions)
Put outliers (after repairing code)
Try flux by angles (opposite to biggest angle, direction normal to opposite edge)
